**LearnSphere** is a "learn-to-earn" decentralized application (dApp) designed to make education in Web3 accessible, engaging, and rewarding. It transforms the complex world of blockchain, the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), and AI agents into a gamified adventure where users complete quests, earn rewards, and level up their skills.

## The Problem

The world of Web3 is expanding rapidly, but for newcomers, it presents a steep and fragmented learning curve. Aspiring developers and enthusiasts often face a scattered landscape of complex information, creating a significant barrier to entry that can be discouraging. Without a clear starting point or structured path, motivation quickly wanes.

**LearnSphere** solves this by providing a curated, incentive-driven educational platform, complete with an AI-powered assistant to guide users on their journey.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Gamified Learning Quests**: A structured curriculum of quests covering foundational topics like Web3, ICP, Fetch.ai, DeFi, and more.
- **Learn-to-Earn Model**: Users are rewarded with tokens and experience points for completing quests, creating a powerful incentive to stay engaged.
- **On-Chain Progress**: All user stats, including completed quests and rewards, are stored on the Internet Computer blockchain, ensuring transparency and ownership.
- **AI-Powered Chat Assistant**: An integrated chatbot, built with Fetch.ai uAgents, acts as a personal tutor, offering instant support and guidance.
- **Interactive Frontend**: A sleek and responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS provides a seamless user experience.
- **Decentralized Backend**: The entire application logic is hosted on-chain through Motoko smart contracts on the Internet Computer.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or later)
- [DFINITY Canister SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/) (`dfx`)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.8 or later)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/learnsphere.git](https://github.com/your-username/learnsphere.git)
    cd learnsphere
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup the Backend Canister:**
    - Start a local replica of the Internet Computer network:
        ```sh
        dfx start --background --clean
        ```
    - Deploy the `learnsphere` canister:
        ```sh
        dfx deploy
        ```

4.  **Setup the AI Agent:**
    - Navigate to the agent directory and install Python dependencies:
        ```sh
        cd ../backend/src/agent
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Run the agent (make sure to update the agent address in `ChatAssistant.jsx` if needed):
        ```sh
        python agent.py
        ```

5.  **Run the Frontend:**
    - Navigate back to the frontend directory and start the development server:
        ```sh
        cd ../../../frontend
        npm run dev
        ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
